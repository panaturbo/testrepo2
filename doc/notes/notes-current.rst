Notes for BIND 9.17.23
----------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Removed Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The IPv6 sockets are now explicitly restricted to sending and receiving IPv6
  packets only.  This renders the ``dig`` option ``+mapped`` non-functioning and
  thus the option has been removed. :gl:`#3093`

Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- With libuv >= 1.37.0, the recvmmsg support would not be enabled in ``named``
  reducing the maximum query-response performance.  The recvmmsg support would
  be used only in libuv 1.35.0 and 1.36.0.  This has been fixed.  :gl:`#3095`
