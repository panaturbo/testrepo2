  <para>
    Until BIND 9.12, new feature development releases were tagged
    as "alpha" and "beta", leading up to the first stable release
    for a given development branch, which always ended in ".0".
    More recently, BIND adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
    release numbering convention. There will be no "alpha" or "beta"
    releases in the 9.15 branch, only increasing version numbers.
    So, for example, what would previously have been called 9.15.0a1,
    9.15.0a2, 9.15.0b1, and so on, will instead be called 9.15.0,
    9.15.1, 9.15.2, etc.
  </para>
  <para>
    The first stable release from this development branch will be
    renamed as 9.16.0. Thereafter, maintenance releases will continue
    on the 9.16 branch, while unstable feature development proceeds in
    9.17.
