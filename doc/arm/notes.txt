Release Notes for BIND Version 9.16.0

Introduction

BIND 9.16 is a stable branch of BIND. This document summarizes significant
changes since the last production release on that branch.

Please see the file CHANGES for a more detailed list of changes and bug
fixes.

Note on Version Numbering

As of BIND 9.13/9.14, BIND has adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
release numbering convention. BIND 9.16 contains new features added during
the BIND 9.15 development process. Henceforth, the 9.16 branch will be
limited to bug fixes and new feature development will proceed in the
unstable 9.17 branch.

Supported Platforms

To build on UNIX-like systems, BIND requires support for POSIX.1c threads
(IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995), the Advanced Sockets API for IPv6 (RFC 3542), and
standard atomic operations provided by the C compiler.

The libuv asynchronous I/O library and the OpenSSL cryptography library
must be available for the target platform. A PKCS#11 provider can be used
instead of OpenSSL for Public Key cryptography (i.e., DNSSEC signing and
validation), but OpenSSL is still required for general cryptography
operations such as hashing and random number generation.

More information can be found in the PLATFORMS.md file that is included in
the source distribution of BIND 9. If your compiler and system libraries
provide the above features, BIND 9 should compile and run. If that isn't
the case, the BIND development team will generally accept patches that add
support for systems that are still supported by their respective vendors.

Download

The latest versions of BIND 9 software can always be found at https://
www.isc.org/download/. There you will find additional information about
each release, source code, and pre-compiled versions for Microsoft Windows
operating systems.

Notes for BIND 9.16.0

Note: this section only lists changes from BIND 9.14 (the previous stable
branch of BIND).

New Features

  * A new asynchronous network communications system based on libuv is now
    used by named for listening for incoming requests and responding to
    them. This change will make it easier to improve performance and
    implement new protocol layers (for example, DNS over TLS) in the
    future. [GL #29]

  * The new dnssec-policy option allows the configuration of a key and
    signing policy (KASP) for zones. This option enables named to generate
    new keys as needed and automatically roll both ZSK and KSK keys. (Note
    that the syntax for this statement differs from the DNSSEC policy used
    by dnssec-keymgr.) [GL #1134]

  * In order to clarify the configuration of DNSSEC keys, the trusted-keys
    and managed-keys statements have been deprecated, and the new
    trust-anchors statement should now be used for both types of key.

    When used with the keyword initial-key, trust-anchors has the same
    behavior as managed-keys, i.e., it configures a trust anchor that is
    to be maintained via RFC 5011.

    When used with the new keyword static-key, trust-anchors has the same
    behavior as trusted-keys, i.e., it configures a permanent trust anchor
    that will not automatically be updated. (This usage is not recommended
    for the root key.) [GL #6]

  * Two new keywords have been added to the trust-anchors statement:
    initial-ds and static-ds. These allow the use of trust anchors in DS
    format instead of DNSKEY format. DS format allows trust anchors to be
    configured for keys that have not yet been published; this is the
    format used by IANA when announcing future root keys.

    As with the initial-key and static-key keywords, initial-ds configures
    a dynamic trust anchor to be maintained via RFC 5011, and static-ds
    configures a permanent trust anchor. [GL #6] [GL #622]

  * dig, mdig and delv can all now take a +yaml option to print output in
    a detailed YAML format. [GL #1145]

  * dig now has a new command line option: +[no]unexpected. By default,
    dig won't accept a reply from a source other than the one to which it
    sent the query. Add the +unexpected argument to enable it to process
    replies from unexpected sources. [RT #44978]

  * dig now accepts a new command line option, +[no]expandaaaa, which
    causes the IPv6 addresses in AAAA records to be printed in full
    128-bit notation rather than the default RFC 5952 format. [GL #765]

  * Statistics channel groups can now be toggled. [GL #1030]

Feature Changes

  * When static and managed DNSSEC keys were both configured for the same
    name, or when a static key was used to configure a trust anchor for
    the root zone and dnssec-validation was set to the default value of
    auto, automatic RFC 5011 key rollovers would be disabled. This
    combination of settings was never intended to work, but there was no
    check for it in the parser. This has been corrected, and it is now a
    fatal configuration error. [GL #868]

  * DS and CDS records are now generated with SHA-256 digests only,
    instead of both SHA-1 and SHA-256. This affects the default output of
    dnssec-dsfromkey, the dsset files generated by dnssec-signzone, the DS
    records added to a zone by dnssec-signzone based on keyset files, the
    CDS records added to a zone by named and dnssec-signzone based on
    "sync" timing parameters in key files, and the checks performed by
    dnssec-checkds. [GL #1015]

  * named will now log a warning if a static key is configured for the
    root zone. [GL #6]

  * A SipHash 2-4 based DNS Cookie (RFC 7873) algorithm has been added and
    made default. Old non-default HMAC-SHA based DNS Cookie algorithms
    have been removed, and only the default AES algorithm is being kept
    for legacy reasons. This change has no operational impact in most
    common scenarios. [GL #605]

    If you are running multiple DNS servers (different versions of BIND 9
    or DNS servers from multiple vendors) responding from the same IP
    address (anycast or load-balancing scenarios), make sure that all the
    servers are configured with the same DNS Cookie algorithm and same
    Server Secret for the best performance.

  * The information from the dnssec-signzone and dnssec-verify commands is
    now printed to standard output. The standard error output is only used
    to print warnings and errors, and in case the user requests the signed
    zone to be printed to standard output with the -f - option. A new
    configuration option -q has been added to silence all output on
    standard output except for the name of the signed zone. [GL #1151]

  * The DNSSEC validation code has been refactored for clarity and to
    reduce code duplication. [GL #622]

  * Compile-time settings enabled by the --with-tuning=large option for
    configure are now in effect by default. Previously used default
    compile-time settings can be enabled by passing --with-tuning=small to
    configure. [GL !2989]

  * JSON-C is now the only supported library for enabling JSON support for
    BIND statistics. The configure option has been renamed from
    --with-libjson to --with-json-c. Set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment
    variable accordingly to specify a custom path to the json-c library,
    as the new configure option does not take the library installation
    path as an optional argument. [GL #855]

  * ./configure no longer sets --sysconfdir to /etc or --localstatedir to
    /var when --prefix is not specified and the aforementioned options are
    not specified explicitly. Instead, Autoconf's defaults of $prefix/etc
    and $prefix/var are respected. [GL #658]

Removed Features

  * The dnssec-enable option has been obsoleted and no longer has any
    effect. DNSSEC responses are always enabled if signatures and other
    DNSSEC data are present. [GL #866]

  * DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) is now obsolete. The
    dnssec-lookaside option has been marked as deprecated; when used in
    named.conf, it will generate a warning but will otherwise be ignored.
    All code enabling the use of lookaside validation has been removed
    from the validator, delv, and the DNSSEC tools. [GL #7]

  * The cleaning-interval option has been removed. [GL !1731]
