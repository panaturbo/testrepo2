  <p>
    BIND 9.17 is an unstable development release of BIND.
    This document summarizes new features and functional changes that
    have been introduced on this branch.  With each development release
    leading up to the stable BIND 9.18 release, this document will be
    updated with additional features added and bugs fixed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please see the file <code class="filename">CHANGES</code> for a more
    detailed list of changes and bug fixes.
  </p>
</div>
  <div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="relnotes_platforms"></a>Supported Platforms</h3></div></div></div>
  <p>
    To build on UNIX-like systems, BIND requires support for POSIX.1c
    threads (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995), the Advanced Sockets API for
    IPv6 (RFC 3542), and standard atomic operations provided by the
    C compiler.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code class="filename">libuv</code> asynchronous I/O library and the
    OpenSSL cryptography library must be available for the target
    platform.  A PKCS#11 provider can be used instead of OpenSSL for
    Public Key cryptography (i.e., DNSSEC signing and validation),
    but OpenSSL is still required for general cryptography operations
    such as hashing and random number generation.
  </p>
  <p>
    More information can be found in the <code class="filename">PLATFORMS.md</code>
    file that is included in the source distribution of BIND 9.  If your
    compiler and system libraries provide the above features, BIND 9
    should compile and run. If that isn't the case, the BIND
    development team will generally accept patches that add support
    for systems that are still supported by their respective vendors.

          We have received reports that in some circumstances, receipt of an
          IXFR can cause the processing of queries to slow significantly. Some
          of these were related to RPZ processing, which has been fixed in this
          release (see below). Others appear to occur where there are
          NSEC3-related changes (such as an operator changing the NSEC3 salt
          used in the hash calculation). These are being investigated.

          to the <span class="command"><strong>response-policy</strong></span> clause in the configuration

          applied if the authoritative nameservers for the query name have been
          looked up and are present in the cache. If this information is not
          present, the RPZ NSDNAME rules are ignored, but the information is
          looked up in the background and applied to subsequent queries. The
          default is <span class="command"><strong>yes</strong></span>, meaning that RPZ NSDNAME rules
          should always be applied, even if the information needs to be looked

          When an RPZ policy zone was updated via zone transfer and a large
          number of records was deleted, <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> could become
          nonresponsive for a short period while deleted names were removed from
          the RPZ summary database. This database cleanup is now done
          incrementally over a longer period of time, reducing such delays.

          <span class="command"><strong>dnssec-policy</strong></span>, the existing keys were immediately
          deleted and replaced with new ones. As the key rollover timing
          constraints were not being followed, it was possible that some clients
          would not have been able to validate responses until all old DNSSEC
          information had timed out from caches. BIND now looks at the time
          metadata of the existing keys and incorporates it into its DNSSEC

          UDP network ports used for listening can no longer simultaneously be
          used for sending traffic.  An example configuration which triggers
          this issue would be one which uses the same

          <span class="command"><strong>listen-on(-v6)</strong></span> statements as for
          <span class="command"><strong>notify-source(-v6)</strong></span> or
          <span class="command"><strong>transfer-source(-v6)</strong></span>.  While this issue affects all
          operating systems, it only triggers log messages (e.g. "unable to
          create dispatch for reserved port") on some of them.  There are
          currently no plans to make such a combination of settings work again.

          When a secondary server receives a large incremental zone
          transfer (IXFR), it can have a negative impact on query
          performance while the incremental changes are applied to
          the zone. To address this, <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> can now
          limit the size of IXFR responses it sends in response to zone
          transfer requests. If an IXFR response would be larger than an
          AXFR of the entire zone, it will send an AXFR response instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          This behavior is controlled by the <span class="command"><strong>max-ixfr-ratio</strong></span>
          option - a percentage value representing the ratio of IXFR size
          to the size of a full zone transfer. The default is

	  name need to be looked up recurively first.  The default is
	  <strong class="userinput"><code>yes</code></strong>.  Setting it to
	  <strong class="userinput"><code>no</code></strong> speeds up initial responses by skipping
	  RPZ-NSDNAME rules when name server domain names are not yet
	  in the cache. The names will be looked up in the background and

          The system-provided POSIX Threads read-write lock implementation is
          now used by default instead of the native BIND 9 implementation.
          Please be aware that glibc versions 2.26 through 2.29 had a
          <a class="link" href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23844" target="_top">bug</a>
          that could cause BIND 9 to deadlock. A fix was released in glibc 2.30,
          and most current Linux distributions have patched or updated glibc,
          with the notable exception of Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) which is a work in
          progress. If you are running on an affected operating system, compile
          BIND 9 with <span class="command"><strong>--disable-pthread-rwlock</strong></span> until a fixed

    BIND 9.17 is an unstable development branch. When its development
    is complete, it will be renamed to BIND 9.18, which will be a
    stable branch.

  <p>
    The end of life date for BIND 9.18 has not yet been determined.
    For those needing long term support, the current Extended Support
    Version (ESV) is BIND 9.11, which will be supported until at
    least December 2021.
