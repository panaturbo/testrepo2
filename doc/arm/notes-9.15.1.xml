          A race condition could trigger an assertion failure when
          a large number of incoming packets were being rejected.
          This flaw is disclosed in CVE-2019-6471. [GL #942]

          In order to clarify the configuration of DNSSEC keys,
          the <command>trusted-keys</command> and
          <command>managed-keys</command> statements have been
          deprecated, and the new <command>dnssec-keys</command>
          statement should now be used for both types of key.
        </para>
        <para>
          When used with the keyword <command>initial-key</command>,
          <command>dnssec-keys</command> has the same behavior as
          <command>managed-keys</command>, i.e., it configures
          a trust anchor that is to be maintained via RFC 5011.
        </para>
        <para>
          When used with the new keyword <command>static-key</command>, it
          has the same behavior as <command>trusted-keys</command>,
          configuring a permanent trust anchor that will not automatically
          be updated.  (This usage is not recommended for the root key.)

          JSON-C is now the only supported library for enabling JSON
          support for BIND statistics. The <command>configure</command>
          option has been renamed from <command>--with-libjson</command>
          to <command>--with-json-c</command>.  Use
          <command>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</command> to specify a custom path to
          the <command>json-c</command> library as the new
          <command>configure</command> option does not take the library
          installation path as an optional argument.
