      <para>
        Added a new command line option to <command>dig</command>:
        <command>+[no]unexpected</command>. By default, <command>dig</command>
        won't accept a reply from a source other than the one to which
        it sent the query.  Add the <command>+unexpected</command> argument
        to enable it to process replies from unexpected sources.

        The GeoIP2 API from MaxMind is now supported. Geolocation support
        will be compiled in by default if the <command>libmaxminddb</command>
        library is found at compile time, but can be turned off by using
        <command>configure --disable-geoip</command>.
      </para>
      <para>
        The default path to the GeoIP2 databases will be set based
        on the location of the <command>libmaxminddb</command> library;
        for example, if it is in <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename>,
        then the default path will be
        <filename>/usr/local/share/GeoIP</filename>.
        This value can be overridden in <filename>named.conf</filename>
        using the <command>geoip-directory</command> option.
      </para>
      <para>
        Some <command>geoip</command> ACL settings that were available with
        legacy GeoIP, including searches for <command>netspeed</command>,
        <command>org</command>, and three-letter ISO country codes, will
        no longer work when using GeoIP2. Supported GeoIP2 database
        types are <command>country</command>, <command>city</command>,
        <command>domain</command>, <command>isp</command>, and
        <command>as</command>. All of these databases support both IPv4
        and IPv6 lookups. [GL #182] [GL #1112]

        In order to clarify the configuration of DNSSEC keys,
        the <command>trusted-keys</command> and
        <command>managed-keys</command> statements have been
        deprecated, and the new <command>dnssec-keys</command>
        statement should now be used for both types of key.
      </para>
      <para>
        When used with the keyword <command>initial-key</command>,
        <command>dnssec-keys</command> has the same behavior as
        <command>managed-keys</command>, i.e., it configures
        a trust anchor that is to be maintained via RFC 5011.
      </para>
      <para>
        When used with the new keyword <command>static-key</command>, it
        has the same behavior as <command>trusted-keys</command>,
        configuring a permanent trust anchor that will not automatically
        be updated.  (This usage is not recommended for the root key.)

        The new <command>add-soa</command> option specifies whether
        or not the <command>response-policy</command> zone's SOA record
        should be included in the additional section of RPZ responses.

      <para>
        Two new metrics have been added to the
        <command>statistics-channel</command> to report DNSSEC
        signing operations.  For each key in each zone, the
        <command>dnssec-sign</command> counter indicates the total
        number of signatures <command>named</command> has generated
        using that key since server startup, and the
        <command>dnssec-refresh</command> counter indicates how
        many of those signatures were refreshed during zone
        maintenance, as opposed to having been generated
        as a result of a zone update.  [GL #513]

        Statistics channel groups are now toggleable. [GL #1030]

        <command>dig</command>, <command>mdig</command> and
        <command>delv</command> can all now take a <command>+yaml</command>
        option to print output in a a detailed YAML format. [RT #1145]
