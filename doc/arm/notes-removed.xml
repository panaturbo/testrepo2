        no longer has any effect. DNSSEC responses are always enabled

        DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) is now obsolete.
        The <command>dnssec-lookaside</command> option has been
        marked as deprecated; when used in <filename>named.conf</filename>,
        it will generate a warning but will otherwise be ignored.
        All code enabling the use of lookaside validation has been removed
        from the validator, <command>delv</command>, and the DNSSEC tools.
