          UDP network ports used for listening can no longer simultaneously be
          used for sending traffic.  An example configuration which triggers
          this issue would be one which uses the same
          <replaceable>address:port</replaceable> pair for
          <command>listen-on(-v6)</command> statements as for
          <command>notify-source(-v6)</command> or
          <command>transfer-source(-v6)</command>.  While this issue affects all
          operating systems, it only triggers log messages (e.g. "unable to
          create dispatch for reserved port") on some of them.  There are
          currently no plans to make such a combination of settings work again.

          When a secondary server receives a large incremental zone
          transfer (IXFR), it can have a negative impact on query
          performance while the incremental changes are applied to
          the zone. To address this, <command>named</command> can now
          limit the size of IXFR responses it sends in response to zone
          transfer requests. If an IXFR response would be larger than an
          AXFR of the entire zone, it will send an AXFR response instead.
        </para>
        <para>
          This behavior is controlled by the <command>max-ixfr-ratio</command>
          option - a percentage value representing the ratio of IXFR size
          to the size of a full zone transfer. The default is
          <literal>100%</literal>. [GL #1515]

          The system-provided POSIX Threads read-write lock implementation is
          now used by default instead of the native BIND 9 implementation.
          Please be aware that glibc versions 2.26 through 2.29 had a
          <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23844">bug</link>
          that could cause BIND 9 to deadlock. A fix was released in glibc 2.30,
          and most current Linux distributions have patched or updated glibc,
          with the notable exception of Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) which is a work in
          progress. If you are running on an affected operating system, compile
          BIND 9 with <command>--disable-pthread-rwlock</command> until a fixed
          version of glibc is available. [GL !3125]
