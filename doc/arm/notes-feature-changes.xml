      <para>
        <command>named</command> will now log a warning if
        a static key is configured for the root zone. [GL #6]
      </para>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        When static and managed DNSSEC keys were both configured for the
        same name, or when a static key was used to
        configure a trust anchor for the root zone and
        <command>dnssec-validation</command> was set to the default
        value of <literal>auto</literal>, automatic RFC 5011 key
        rollovers would be disabled. This combination of settings was
        never intended to work, but there was no check for it in the
        parser. This has been corrected, and it is now a fatal
        configuration error. [GL #868]
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        DS and CDS records are now generated with SHA-256 digests
        only, instead of both SHA-1 and SHA-256. This affects the
        default output of <command>dnssec-dsfromkey</command>, the
        <filename>dsset</filename> files generated by
        <command>dnssec-signzone</command>, the DS records added to
        a zone by <command>dnssec-signzone</command> based on
        <filename>keyset</filename> files, the CDS records added to
        a zone by <command>named</command> and
        <command>dnssec-signzone</command> based on "sync" timing
        parameters in key files, and the checks performed by
        <command>dnssec-checkds</command>.
      </para>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        JSON-C is now the only supported library for enabling JSON
        support for BIND statistics. The <command>configure</command>
        option has been renamed from <command>--with-libjson</command>
        to <command>--with-json-c</command>.  Use
        <command>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</command> to specify a custom path to
        the <command>json-c</command> library as the new
        <command>configure</command> option does not take the library
        installation path as an optional argument.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        A SipHash 2-4 based DNS Cookie (RFC 7873) algorithm has been added and
        made default.  Old non-default HMAC-SHA based DNS Cookie algorithms
        have been removed, and only the default AES algorithm is being kept
        for legacy reasons.  This change doesn't have any operational impact
        in most common scenarios. [GL #605]
      </para>
      <para>
        If you are running multiple DNS Servers (different versions of BIND 9
        or DNS server from multiple vendors) responding from the same IP
        address (anycast or load-balancing scenarios), you'll have to make
        sure that all the servers are configured with the same DNS Cookie
        algorithm and same Server Secret for the best performance.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        The information from the <command>dnssec-signzone</command> and
        <command>dnssec-verify</command> commands is now printed to standard
        output.  The standard error output is only used to print warnings and
        errors, and in case the user requests the signed zone to be printed to
        standard output with <command>-f -</command> option.  A new
        configuration option <command>-q</command> has been added to silence
        all output on standard output except for the name of the signed zone.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        DS records included in DNS referral messages can now be validated
        and cached immediately, reducing the number of queries needed for
        a DNSSEC validation. [GL #964]
      </para>
