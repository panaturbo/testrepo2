          The GeoIP2 API from MaxMind is now supported. Geolocation support
          will be compiled in by default if the <command>libmaxminddb</command>
          library is found at compile time, but can be turned off by using
          <command>configure --disable-geoip</command>.
        </para>
        <para>
          The default path to the GeoIP2 databases will be set based
          on the location of the <command>libmaxminddb</command> library;
          for example, if it is in <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename>,
          then the default path will be
          <filename>/usr/local/share/GeoIP</filename>.
          This value can be overridden in <filename>named.conf</filename>
          using the <command>geoip-directory</command> option.
        </para>
        <para>
          Some <command>geoip</command> ACL settings that were available with
          legacy GeoIP, including searches for <command>netspeed</command>,
          <command>org</command>, and three-letter ISO country codes, will
          no longer work when using GeoIP2. Supported GeoIP2 database
          types are <command>country</command>, <command>city</command>,
          <command>domain</command>, <command>isp</command>, and
          <command>as</command>. All of these databases support both IPv4
          and IPv6 lookups. [GL #182] [GL #1112]

        <para>
          Two new metrics have been added to the
          <command>statistics-channel</command> to report DNSSEC
          signing operations.  For each key in each zone, the
          <command>dnssec-sign</command> counter indicates the total
          number of signatures <command>named</command> has generated
          using that key since server startup, and the
          <command>dnssec-refresh</command> counter indicates how
          many of those signatures were refreshed during zone
          maintenance, as opposed to having been generated
          as a result of a zone update.  [GL #513]

        <para>
          When <command>qname-minimization</command> was set to
          <command>relaxed</command>, some improperly configured domains
          would fail to resolve, but would have succeeded when minimization
          was disabled. <command>named</command> will now fall back to normal
          resolution in such cases, and also uses type A rather than NS for
          minimal queries in order to reduce the likelihood of encountering
          the problem. [GL #1055]

        <para>
          <command>./configure</command> no longer sets
          <command>--sysconfdir</command> to <command>/etc</command> or
          <command>--localstatedir</command> to <command>/var</command>
          when <command>--prefix</command> is not specified and the
          aforementioned options are not specified explicitly. Instead,
          Autoconf's defaults of <command>$prefix/etc</command> and
          <command>$prefix/var</command> are respected.

          Glue address records were not being returned in responses
          to root priming queries; this has been corrected. [GL #1092]
